   * FOR 2026 - REBUILT, store the data from the FMS about the TeleOp shifts here
   *
   * <p>Once the FMS chooses an alliance, this value will become either 'B' or 'R' for which
   * alliance's HUB is INACTIVE first.
   *
   * <p>If this variable is 'B', then BLUE is ACTIVE during Shift 2 and Shift 4 (and RED is ACTIVE
   * during Shift 1 and Shift 3).
   *
   * <p>If this variable is 'R', then RED is ACTIVE during Shift 2 and Shift 4 (and BLUE is ACTIVE
   * during Shift 1 and Shift 3).
   *
   * <p>========== TESTING ==========
   *
   * <p>You can test your Game Specific Data code without FMS by using the Driver Station. Click on
   * the Setup tab of the Driver Station, then enter the desired test string into the Game Data text
   * field. The data will be transmitted to the robot in one of two conditions: Enable the robot in
   * Teleop mode, or when the DS reaches the End Game time in a Practice Match (times are
   * configurable on the Setup tab). It is recommended to run at least one match using the Practice
   * functionality to verify that your code works correctly in a full match flow.
